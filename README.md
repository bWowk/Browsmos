# Browsmos

## About

In the words of Stephen Eisenhauer: "Browsmos is a game the web browser, made entirely using HTML5, and inspired
heavily by the gameplay of Osmos.

The rules are simple; click to propel yourself around, and try to absorb
smaller cells until you become the biggest. Watch out for larger cells, or
they will absorb you!"
